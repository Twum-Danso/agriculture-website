            <p><b>MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION IN GHANA'S AGRICULTURE</b> <p>
                    
                One of the challenges to Ghana's agricultural economy is its lack of transportation. Transportation is fundamental to the distribution of crops and livestock. Ghana has seen its economic growth slow down in recent years, particularly its agricultural market. Transportation helps farmers link their products to local consumers. It helps link rural communities to the marketplace, and increases economic productivity. It would help expand the market to the entire country, instead of local communities.
                
                <p>As of 2009, Ghana has a road network stretching 67,448 km. 41% of the road network considered to be in decent condition, which is a major hindrance for the transport of agricultural products. Farmers in Ghana have complained about the country's lack of transportation. The World Bank strongly advised Ghana to drastically improve its transportation to improve its agriculture and economy. According to David Asare Asiamah (Founder and CEO of AgroMindest), "Most of the farm produce just go to waste in the remote areas because farmers find it difficult transporting their farm produce to the market to sell. The roads donâ€™t exist and most remote areas find themselves cut off from the rest of the country. And because there are no proper storage facilities in these areas, a lot of the produce just rot away".
                
                    <p>There have been recent attempts to improve the transportation of agriculture in Ghana. In 2018, a Ghanaian startup, Agrocenta, won a 500,000 investment from Seedstars World. The role of Agrocenta is to use its online platform to connect local farmers to an online market. Trucks are then available to any farmer in small village with the click of a button. Agrocenta connects local farmers to buyers that purchase the goods at fair market prices.
